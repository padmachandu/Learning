What is dependency injection in Angular ??

DI is a design pattern in angular which injects dependencies from external sources, instead of class/component creating them.

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern where a class (or component) gets its dependencies from an external source
(Angular’s injector) rather than creating them itself.

const service = new UserService();
              (or)
constructor(private userService: UserService) {}

Loose Coupling: classes don’t need to know how to create dependencies.
Re-usability: services can be reused across components.
Testability:
Maintanability:
