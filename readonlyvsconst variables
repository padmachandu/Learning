readonly and const variables
const and readonly both prevent modification, but they have key differences in when and how they are assigned."

const 
A const variable must be assigned a value at the time of declaration and cannot be changed later. It is implicitly static and shared across all instances of the class."
readonly
"A readonly variable can be assigned a value at runtime, either when declared or inside the constructor, but once assigned, it cannot be changed."

If the value is fixed forever, use const. If itâ€™s set during object creation and never changes, use readonly."

class MathConstants
{
    public const double Pi = 3.14159;  // Must be assigned at compile time
}
class Circle
{
    public readonly double Radius;  // Assigned at runtime

    public Circle(double radius)
    {
        Radius = radius;  // Can be assigned here
    }
}
