What is pipe in Angular???
Pipe in angular transforms the data before  displaying it in the view.

lowercase, uppercase, date, currency, percentage , async pipes

What is a pure pipe??
A pure pipe is a pipe which gets called if there is a pure change in the input value.
By default every pipe is a pure pipe.

Example:
-------
@pipe({
name: 'filter',
pure: true/false
})

What is an impure pipe???
An impure pipe is a pipe which gets called for every change detection cycle. And it is performs instensive.

We shoud not use pipes for filtering and sorting due to it's inconsistent behavior.
We should not use impure pipes in our applicaion as it gets called for every change detection cycle.
which leads to performance issues.

What is an async pipe ??

Async pipe subscribes to an observable or promise and returns the latest value emitted.
