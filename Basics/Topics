What interviewers ACTUALLY expect (very important)
For each subject, they expect this depth only:

What it is → Why it’s used → How you used it → One example → One pitfall
------------------------------------------------------------------------
You need strong basics + depth in common areas + confidence in explanation

Most interviews test:
How you think
How you explain
How you’ve used things in real projects
Not how much you memorized.

WHAT TO FOCUS ON (Subject-wise)
1️⃣ C# (MOST IMPORTANT – foundation)

Focus on 20–25 core topics only

Must-focus areas

OOP (real-world examples)

SOLID (1 example each – no theory dump)

Value vs Reference types

struct vs class

interface vs abstract class

async / await

Task vs Thread

Exception handling

Collections

LINQ (how + when)

Memory basics (stack vs heap)

const vs readonly

IDisposable, using

Delegates, Func, Action (basic)

Nullable reference types

Records (basic idea)

👉 Depth rule:
Explain each in 2–3 minutes max
