Scopes in Dependency Injection (DI) Transient, Scoped and Singleton ??

Asp.Net core DI supports 3 lifetimes AddTransient, AddScoped and AddSingleton
AddTransient : Creates a new instance every time it's requested.
AddScoped: Creates one instance per HTTP request.
AddSingletone: Creates single instance per application lifetime.

What is JWT and how does it work ??

JWT (Json Web Token)
It'a an open standard for securely tranmitting the data between the parties as a JSON object.
Used for authentication and authorization in modern web applications. (Especially REST API's) 

Structure of a JWT:
A JWT has 3 parts seperated by dot .

Header.Payload.Signature
Header - Algorithm & token type
Payload - Claims (UserInfo, Roles, Expiry)
Signature - Created using Header + Payload + Secret Key
How JWT Works (Authentication Flow)

What is Middleware?
Middleware is a software component that processes the HTTP requests and responses in the pipeline.

How Middleware Works (Pipeline Flow)
Request → [Middleware 1] → [Middleware 2] → [Middleware 3] → Endpoint
Response ← [Middleware 1] ← [Middleware 2] ← [Middleware 3] ← Endpoint

Built-in Middleware Examples

UseRouting → Matches route.
UseAuthentication → Validates user.
UseAuthorization → Checks user permissions.
UseEndpoints → Executes matched controller/action.
UseStaticFiles → Serves CSS/JS/images.

Why do you use an interface???

Difference between const, readonly, static.
