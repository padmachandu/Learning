What is a service in angular??
------------------------------

Services are piece of code which performs a specific task. Services consist s of the reusable logic that been consumed in multiple places. 
when we will go for a service?

We will create a service for re-usability. If the same logic has been consumedby multiple compoennets then we will include the logic in a service and cosume it 
in the application or a component. We will inject the created services to the pplication or component using dependency injection mechanism.

Example:
--------
import {@Injectable} from '@angular/core';

@Injectable()({
providedIn : 'root'
}) 
Note: // If you declare it as root then no need to provide in the providers section of a component.
------ 
( or )
@Injectable()
export service MyService{
//Methods and proerties
}
How to consume service in a component 

@component({
selector: 'app-my-component',
template:  './mycomponent.compoent.html',
templateUrls: ['./mycomponent.compoennt.css'],
providers: [MyService]
})
ccnstructor(private _myService:MyService){ }
students: any[];

ngOnInit()
{
  this.students = this._myService.getAllStudents();
}

Advantages:

1. Re-usability
