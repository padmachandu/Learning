ref and out keywords - By using ref and out keywords we can pass the parameters by reference.
when you want to return more than values from a method you can use out and ref parameters. 

ref and out are both used to pass arguments by reference, meaning any changes made inside the method affect the original variable outside.
However, the key difference is initialization:"
ref requires the variable to be initialized before passing it.
out does not require initialization; the method must assign a value before returning.

"For example, if I have a method that modifies an existing value, I use ref. If I have a method that returns multiple values and doesn't need an initial value, I use out."

void ModifyValue(ref int num) { num += 10; }
int value = 5;
ModifyValue(ref value); // value becomes 15

void GetValues(out int x, out int y) { x = 10; y = 20; }
int a, b;
GetValues(out a, out b); // a = 10, b = 20
