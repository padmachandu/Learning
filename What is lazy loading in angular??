What is lazy loading in Angular ??

Lazy loading in angular is a technique where feature modules are loaded only when needed, instead of the application startup.
We configure it in the router using LoadChildren

const routes: Routes = [
{ path: 'customers',
loadChildren: () => import('./customers/customers.module').then(m => m.CustomersModule) }
];

Benefits of Lazy Loading

🚀 Improves performance → smaller initial bundle size.
🧩 Better user experience → first screen loads quickly.
⚡ On-demand loading → loads only what the user needs.
📦 Code splitting → easier to manage large apps.
