What is ref and out parameters in c#??
Both ref and out parameters are used to pass the arguments by reference
The difference is that with ref, the variable must be initialized before passing, and the method may or may not change it.
With out, the variable doesnâ€™t need to be initialized before passing, but the method is required to assign a value before 
returning
ref is used when you want to update an existing value, while out is used when you want to return multiple values from a method.
