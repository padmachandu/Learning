What is the differece between observables vs promises??

observables vs promises for handling asynchronous functionality.

Observables:
1) Observables is hvaving 3 callback functions

Success
Error
Complete
2)Observables are lazy



Promises:

1) Promises has 2 call back 
Success
Error
2) promises are not lazy , promises are eager 

Promises and Observables both handle the asynchronous call only.
Here are the differences between them:

Observable
------------
Emits multiple values over a period of time
Is not called until we subscribe to the Observable
Can be canceled by using the unsubscribe() method
Provides the map, forEach, filter, reduce, retry, and retryWhen operators

Promise
---------
Emits only a single value at a time
Calls the services without .then and .catch
Cannot be canceled
Does not provide any operators
